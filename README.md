# BayMax - Medical Personal Agent

> **An adorable Medical Personal Agent that cares for you, designed to be secure and compliant.**

**Build Personal Agents Hackathon Project Submission**

Baymax is a privacy-first personal medical assistant that helps you take care of yourself before health becomes an emergency. It remembers what matters, nudges you to follow through, and helps you carry your health context wherever life takes you.

## UI walkthroughs

A conversation-first care companion built with **Assistant UI**, React, TypeScript, and Vite. Baymax surfaces interactive care cards inside the chat, with a centered animated mascot, a pill composer, and bottom navigation.

### Prepare for a hackathon

Plan your date, check off small wins, and complete a daily energy check-in without leaving the conversation.

### Prescription concierge

A diabetes medication refill **order preview** with a visible workflow, professional verification requirements, and review controls. No medication is purchased or prescribed by this frontend.

### Email a doctor brief

Edit the brief in chat, enter a recipient, and review the email before opening a draft in your email app. The user sends the email there; server-side delivery is not implemented.

### Our 2D companion

## Run locally

Requires Node.js 22+.

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open the local URL Vite prints.

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Implemented frontend

- Conversation-first Assistant UI runtime with streamed fixture responses.
- Generative UI rendered through `makeAssistantToolUI` and tool-call message parts.
- Editable inline care plans and travel checklists.
- Prescription order preview with review and confirmation states.
- Doctor brief editing, recipient validation, email review, and `mailto:` handoff.
- Daily check-ins, hydration logging, movement tasks, and preferences.
- Session-only state; navigation preserves the conversation, refresh clears it.
- Mobile and desktop layouts, keyboard-accessible dialogs, and reduced-motion support.

## Sponsor integration status

| Sponsor | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Assistant UI | Implemented: runtime, message primitives, composer, suggestions, tool UI |
| Mastra | Next: replace the fixture adapter with server-side agent orchestration |
| Neon | Next: consent-based profile and agent memory |
| Exa | Next: source-backed travel and pharmacy research |
| Fly.io | Dockerfile, Nginx config, and starter Fly configuration included; not deployed |

The frontend has no live LLM, pharmacy, payment, email delivery, database, or background notification connection. The GIFs use fictional details. UI copy avoids implementation badges while the repository documents these limits.

## Fly.io deployment preparation

The included Dockerfile builds the Vite frontend and serves it on port 8080. Choose an available app name in `fly.toml`, then use your Fly account to create and deploy the app. No deployment or billing action has been performed.

## The idea

You have an assistant for work. Why not one for your health?

Baymax is the caring, persistent companion that checks in on your habits, helps you prepare for busy weeks, and makes navigating healthcare while travelling less overwhelming.

## Focus areas

- **Preventative care:** reminders for appointments, checkups, and follow-ups based on your care plan.
- **Lifestyle:**
  - **Exercise:** achievable movement goals, activity check-ins, and gentle accountability.
  - **Diet:** meal planning, habit tracking, and reminders aligned with your preferences and goals.
- **Personal context:** a health profile and memory that you control.

## Use cases

- **Proactive care:** support for exercise and diet through achievable goals, meal planning, and gentle reminders.
- **Prescription meds ordering:** identify where to buy prescribed medication and help order it for you. Research and ordering are planned capabilities; the current prototype provides an order preview.
- **Medical brief for new doctors when travelling:** prepare a concise health summary to review and share with a new doctor.

### 1. Proactive care: exercise and diet

BayMax helps you build everyday exercise and diet habits with achievable movement goals, meal planning, activity check-ins, and gentle accountability. Reminders should be adjustable, snoozable, and easy to turn off.

For a busy week or hackathon, it can help you plan a routine around sleep, meals, hydration, movement, and your existing medication schedule.

### 2. Prescription meds ordering

Travelling and running low on your prescribed medication? Baymax helps you prepare a medication summary, research local prescription requirements and pharmacy options, and identify questions to ask a licensed clinician or pharmacist.

It supports the process; it does not issue prescriptions, authorize purchases, or recommend medication substitutions.

### 3. Briefing a new doctor while travelling

Baymax drafts a concise, user-reviewed health brief containing the information you choose to share: current medications, allergies, relevant history, recent concerns, and questions for your appointment.

Review it, edit it, and share it with your new doctor so you do not have to start from zero.

## Privacy first. HIPAA compliance as a design goal.

Health information deserves deliberate protection. Our goal is a HIPAA-compliant, privacy-first product.

**This hackathon project is a frontend prototype. HIPAA compliance has not been verified, and no completed security controls are claimed. Use synthetic data for demos.**

Planned safeguards include:

- Explicit consent for storing health information and sharing it with external services.
- Data minimization and user-controlled memory.
- Encryption in transit and at rest.
- Authentication, access controls, and audit logging.
- User options to review, export, and delete stored information.
- Keeping identifiable health information out of public repositories, application logs, and web-search queries.
- Reviewing vendor agreements, data flows, and deployment requirements before handling real protected health information.

## Sponsors and stack we aim to use

Assistant UI is implemented. The remaining integrations are planned; see the integration status above. These are not claims of confirmed partnerships.

| Technology | Planned role |
| --- | --- |
| [Mastra](https://mastra.ai/) | Agent orchestration, tools, and workflows |
| [Neon](https://neon.com/) | Agent memory and structured data storage |
| [Assistant UI](https://www.assistant-ui.com/) | Conversational interface |
| [Exa](https://exa.ai/) | Web research for travel and healthcare logistics, using queries without identifiable health information |
| [Fly.io](https://fly.io/) | Application hosting and deployment |

## Planned hackathon MVP

- [ ] Conversational onboarding with a synthetic health profile.
- [ ] User-controlled agent memory.
- [ ] Daily lifestyle check-ins and configurable reminders.
- [ ] A hackathon preparation routine.
- [ ] A travel medication support workflow with source links.
- [ ] A doctor-ready health brief with review before sharing.
- [ ] Privacy controls and a documented data flow.

## Demo story

“I’m travelling for a hackathon next week. Help me prepare, keep me on track every day, and help me explain my health history if I need to see a doctor.”

Baymax turns that request into a preparation routine, daily check-ins, a medication travel checklist, and a health brief the user can review.

## Project status

**Frontend implemented.** Interactive UI flows and animated walkthroughs are ready for the hackathon. Sponsor backend integrations, real prescription fulfilment, email delivery, deployment, and compliance verification remain to be built.

## Medical boundaries

Baymax is intended to support organization, habits, and healthcare conversations. It does not replace a licensed healthcare professional, diagnose conditions, prescribe medication, or provide emergency care.
